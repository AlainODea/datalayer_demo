Data Layer Architecture Demonstration
=====================================
This project is a demonstration of using interface-oriented design to fully
separate the View from the Model at compile-time, yet still allow a fully
functional integrated application to be composed at runtime.

This example uses Maven's multi-module features in the interest of portability.
